# Geomorfometría - Northness & Eastness (PA02)

This repository contains my classroom practice (PA02) for the course Geomorphology (GEO-114).
The exercise calculates **Northness (cos(aspect))** and **Eastness (sin(aspect))** from a DEM (SRTM 30m),
using two routes:

- **Route A (R / terra)**  
- **Route B (Python / rasterio + numpy)**  

Results are exported as GeoTIFFs and PNGs for comparison.
